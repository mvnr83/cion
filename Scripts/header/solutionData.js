		"Phillies ace Roy Halladay made history in Miami on Saturday, tossing the 20th perfect game in MLB history vs. the Marlins in a 1-0 win. It was the first no-hitter of Halladay's brilliant career.",
		"Jim Thome hit his 569th home run to move into a tie for 11th place all-time. Alfonso Soriano, Andre Ethier and Hanley Ramirez each hit two long balls to cap their sizzling weekends.",
		"Detroit's Justin Verlander, St. Louis' Chris Carpenter and Colorado's Jhoulys Chacin all threw gems Sunday. But Tampa Bay's Wade Davis outdueled Zack Greinke in a tight 1-0 win.",
		"Ty Wigginton's double in the 10th made the Orioles walk-off winners, 3-2, to sweep the Red Sox. The Rangers tied the Mariners in the ninth and won, 3-1, on a sac fly and passed ball in the 11th."
