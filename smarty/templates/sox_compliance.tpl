These  scandals, which cost investors billions of dollars when the share prices of  affected companies collapsed, shook public confidence in the nation's  securities markets.</p>

                     <h3><strong>Why  comply with SOX?</strong></h3>
                     <p>Compliance with SOX regulations is not optional for public companies. Itâ€™s  a mandatory process forcing companies to submit an annual report containing  details of their internal accounting structure to the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC). Non-compliance can lead to penalties including large fines, delisting  and for the worst offenses even imprisonment of corporate officers involved in  the misappropriation of financial data.</p>
                     <h3><strong>IT  Helps the SOX Compliance</strong></h3>
                       <p>Enterprises  depend on IT to manage the internal controls by providing a secure Identity and  Access Management policy complying with SOX guidelines. One of the main  functions of IT is to ensure that all financial transactions and data entry are  carried out only by authorized personnel. In many companies this is a very  time-intensive activity requiring extra resources and increasing the cost to  the organization.</p>
                       <p>This legislation has  multiple titles/sections, each corresponding to specific guidelines. For IT organizations,  Section 404 and a portion of Section 302 specify how IT can help achieve  compliance. In some cases, Section 409 is also considered important.</p>
