          <p>Your server and workstation environment is the foundation of  your mission critical services. The health of this environment is  paramount.&nbsp; Having a solid configuration assessment helps you easily  identify specific areas of concern, and get the most out of your infrastructure. </p>
          <p>Getting your baseline early and having something to measure  against is important when implementing efficiency standards across your IT  organization. Knowing what changed at a granular level, and quickly identifying  the problem areas not only saves you a lot of time, but also changes your  approach. </p>
          <p>When something goes wrong, in many cases administrators  prefer to reinstall everything rather than taking a chance. CionSystems offers  a better solution- one that will save you a lot of time and provide the answers  you need to clearly identify the culprits.</p></td>
